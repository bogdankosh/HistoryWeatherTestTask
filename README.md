# HistoryWeatherTestTask

This app parses historical weather data from data.gov.uk, stores it and builts graphs based on that data (only line graph is available at the moment).

The app uses [Charts] framework for iOS. 

### Usage: 
To launch the app there's no need to run `pod install`, required frameworks are already embedded in the project, simply run `HistoryWeatherTestTask.xcworkspace`.
